The strongest winds were experienced in central and east-central Iowa where 100+ mph winds were observed. Some of the strongest winds were in an area from roughly Marshalltown, IA eastward along the Highway 30 corridor to the Mississippi River, where estimated winds exceeded 120+ mph and approached 140 mph. A number of QLCS tornadoes were also experienced within the Highway 30 corridor. One of the most remarkable aspects of the derecho was the duration of severe winds, with many areas experiencing at least periodic, if not persistent, severe level (58+ mph) winds over a roughly 30 minute time frame. As the derecho moved eastward out of Iowa, it continued to expand, but weakened from its peak strength. Winds continued to exceed severe criteria (58+ mph) in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan and began to produce additional QLCS tornadoes across northern Illinois before fading out across northern Indiana and southern Michigan.||In the wake of the derecho, damage was substantial in many areas, rural and urban. Many agriculture fields, mainly corn, were flattened within the swaths of strongest winds. Initial estimates suggest at least 850,000 acres of partial or complete crop loss occurred from this event. Within urban and wooded areas extensive tree and structure damage was seen, including complete roof failure in a few instances. At its peak, total estimated customers without power exceeded 1.4 million across the affected states. In total, early estimates on losses (agriculture, infrastructure, private property) have exceeded $7.5 billion across the states affected. ||Environment: Broadly speaking, it was a ripe day for thunderstorms across the affected area with MUCAPE values often exceeding 3500-4000 J/kg by the mid morning hours concurrent with mid-upper level short wave support, and indications that any cold pool development would be strong (difference between cold pool and ambient air) and potentially long lived. For detailed environmental analysis, including soundings, please view the various local NWS office event review pages: NWS Des Moines, NWS Quad Cities, NWS Chicago, NWS Milwaukee, NWS Central Illinois, NWS Northern Indiana, or NWS Indianapolis.||Additional Details: Numerous injuries occurred during the derecho and in the aftermath during cleanup, including 4 direct and indirect deaths of which 3 occurred in Iowa (two in Poweshiek County and one in Linn County) and 1 in Indiana (Fort Wayne).||Disclaimer: The August 10, 2020 derecho resulted in widespread high-end damage across large portions of central and southern Iowa.

The path was found in high resolution satellite imagery. The tornado was on the leading edge of a larger swath of straight line winds that snapped trees and destroyed outbuildings and grain bins. There was no damage directly attributable to the tornado from which an EF-scale rating could be assigned. Thus, the tornado is designated EF-U.","A powerful line of severe thunderstorms produced a derecho which tracked across eastern Iowa and northwest Illinois on the afternoon of Monday, August 10th, resulting in widespread straight line wind damage. The cost of damage from this storm was extreme, reaching an estimated 7.5 billion dollars along the path of these storms from Iowa through Illinois.  Two brief tornadoes have been confirmed within the widespread swath of wind damage, one just north of the Eastern Iowa Airport in Linn County Iowa, and one just south of Freeport, Illinois. These tornadoes have been designated as EF-U, as there was no observable damage directly attributable to the tornadoes from which an EF-scale rating could be assigned. While an average of two derechos a year occur across the area, a derecho of this intensity is a roughly once-in-a-decade occurrence. Another unusual aspect of this derecho was the duration of the strong winds, with gusts over 60 mph for over an hour at some locations.||The most extreme winds, estimated at 110-140 mph, destroyed or damaged numerous outbuildings, barns, grain bins, homes, mobile homes, apartment buildings, trees, and power poles in parts of Benton, Linn, Jones, Cedar, and Clinton Counties. The Cedar Rapids area was particularly hard hit. One fatality occurred in Linn County, as a tree fell on a cyclist. Several homes, apartment complexes, and businesses sustained damage consistent with 130-140 mph winds. Radio transmission towers in Marion and Clinton, Iowa collapsed due to winds estimated around 130 mph. Wind gusts of 80-100 mph were common as the line of storms moved through the Quad Cities area and then through northwest Illinois. A small pocket of winds estimated at 100-110 mph impacted Princeton, IL in Bureau County, where a 150 foot communications tower collapsed and numerous power poles were snapped. In addition to the damage, numerous long-duration power outages occurred across the region. Damage to crops was considerable along the derecho path.

The tornado moved through neighborhood of acreages along Quentin trail where it snapped many trees but moved in between the homes.

Beyond this point, the tree damage was sporadic and more evident of the larger scale wind field. Should also note that to the west of this tornado track, there was a debris signature evident on radar, but the damage was much more consistent with a focused downburst or series of downbursts that moved up from the Missouri Valley into the Loess Hills and may have helped to loft light leafy debris.

The tornado caused sporadic tree damage, including several large trees on the Clinton County courthouse lawn. The tornado was captured on webcam video at the riverfront, where it moved a boat docked near the Candlelight Inn in Clinton. Maximum winds were estimated around 75 mph. The tornado was rated EF0.","Very hot and humid air in place across eastern Iowa, northwest Illinois, and far northeast Missouri interacted with a southward moving frontal boundary and disturbance aloft, setting the stage for development and organization of severe thunderstorms across the region. Storms initially formed from north central Iowa and southern Wisconsin along the frontal boundary, which slowly worked south into the hot, humid air in place across the region. As storms arrived across east central Iowa, they began producing winds around 70 MPH across the Hwy 20 corridor. Another storm to the south further intensified, and began producing winds of 80+ MPH as it tracked along the Hwy 30 corridor. This impacted the northern suburbs of Cedar Rapids into Clinton. These storms continued to produce wind gusts around 60-70 MPH as they progressed into northwest Illinois. One brief EF-0 tornado began in Clinton, Iowa, then moved across the Mississippi River before dissipating near Fulton, Illinois. Damage near Andrew, Iowa in Jackson County was determined to be straight-line winds. Storms additionally produced large hail around the Dubuque metro, with quarter size hail reported.",442
