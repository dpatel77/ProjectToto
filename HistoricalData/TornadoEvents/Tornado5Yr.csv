Path found via high resolution satellite imagery.  The tornado impacted no damage indicators, hence the EFU rating.","Basic Summary: A cluster of storms in northeast Nebraska and southeast South Dakota developed into the destructive derecho that raced eastward across large portions of Iowa, northern Illinois, southern Wisconsin, northern Indiana, and southern Michigan during the morning and afternoon of August 10th. The strongest winds were experienced in central and east-central Iowa where 100+ mph winds were observed. Some of the strongest winds were in an area from roughly Marshalltown, IA eastward along the Highway 30 corridor to the Mississippi River, where estimated winds exceeded 120+ mph and approached 140 mph. A number of QLCS tornadoes were also experienced within the Highway 30 corridor. One of the most remarkable aspects of the derecho was the duration of severe winds, with many areas experiencing at least periodic, if not persistent, severe level (58+ mph) winds over a roughly 30 minute time frame. As the derecho moved eastward out of Iowa, it continued to expand, but weakened from its peak strength. Winds continued to exceed severe criteria (58+ mph) in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan and began to produce additional QLCS tornadoes across northern Illinois before fading out across northern Indiana and southern Michigan.||In the wake of the derecho, damage was substantial in many areas, rural and urban. Many agriculture fields, mainly corn, were flattened within the swaths of strongest winds. Initial estimates suggest at least 850,000 acres of partial or complete crop loss occurred from this event. Within urban and wooded areas extensive tree and structure damage was seen, including complete roof failure in a few instances. At its peak, total estimated customers without power exceeded 1.4 million across the affected states.

The tornado continued northeast and lifted one mile south of the Buena Vista County Conservation Park at 1712CST.  ||Shortly after touchdown, the tornado partially collapsed the roof on a hog confinement which killed 13 hogs. Debris from this building was strewn for one to two miles to the northeast.  On a northeastward track, another animal confinement farm was struck by the tornado after a couple minutes which resulted in loss of several roof panels on multiple buildings. At this point the tornado shifted path toward more of a north-northeast direction and moved into Aurelia.  A drying unit was removed from the top of a grain elevator on the south edge of town.  Most of the damage throughout the eastern half of Aurelia was snapped trees, which caused collateral damage to numerous roofs and windows along the path. The tornado moved through the golf course snapping and uprooting numerous trees. The tornado continued with a shift to a more northeast track, and destroyed a barn and three outbuildings along 535th Street northeast of Aurelia. Additional damage occurred to a machine shed and large trees along the Cherokee and Buena Vista County line. The tornado was rated EF1 in both Cherokee and Buena Vista Counties.

It featured the first-ever December derecho observed anywhere in the United States and the first Moderate Risk of severe thunderstorms issued by the NWS Storm Prediction Center in December for Iowa. Unofficially, it set the new single-day Iowa records for the most tornadoes and the most EF-2/F-2 or stronger tornadoes since 1950.  Finally, it will break the all-time December record high temperature for Iowa. ||Tornadoes: There were 63 confirmed tornadoes that occurred in Iowa, 21 of which were rated EF-2. Sixty three is unofficially the most tornadoes in Iowa in a single day with the previous being 35 tornadoes on August 31, 2014. Further, 21 EF-2 tornadoes is unofficially the most EF-2/F-2 or stronger tornadoes in a single day with the previous being 16 tornadoes on June 7, 1984. Prior to this event, a total of 5 tornadoes had occurred in Iowa in December since 1950 with all of them in southeastern Iowa.  | |Thunderstorm Wind: Numerous straight line wind gusts were also associated with these thunderstorms, some in excess of 80 mph.  During the event, nearly the entire state of Iowa was under a Severe Thunderstorm Warning at some point.  Audubon reported the highest gust in Iowa at 88 mph. This storm also met the criteria for a ���derecho'', which makes it the first derecho on record in the month of December anywhere in the United States.  Finally, we had an unofficial gust of 108 mph recorded by a mesonet station near Sheffield, Iowa associated with one of the tornadic circulations. ||Environmental Wind: After the line of storms had passed, numerous strong, non-thunderstorm wind gusts over 70 mph occurred overnight. The top three non-thunderstorm wind gusts were 83 mph in Decatur City, 81 mph in Marshalltown, and 80 mph in Johnston. The Des Moines International Airport recorded a 74 mph non-thunderstorm wind gust, which is the highest non-thunderstorm wind gust at this location since 1970.| |Temperatures: In addition to the severe weather and strong non-thunderstorm winds, the temperatures were remarkable and record setting.

Occasional minor tree damage was also observed south of the path, due to straight line winds.","Scattered severe storms tracked across southeast Iowa during the mid-afternoon into early evening of June 24, producing large hail up to golf ball size in Van Buren County and tennis ball size hail near Ottumwa.||More organized clusters of severe storms tracked through Dubuque into far northwest IL during the evening and late night hours of June 24.

The tornado moved rapidly to the east where it made a direct impact on a home. At this location, the home roof was removed, windows broken, siding ruined, numerous trees snapped, a shed was demolished, and numerous items were thrown up to a half mile downstream. The convergent damage pattern at this location, eyewitness reports of wind direction, along with the 80-yard-wide path of more intense damage gives great confidence that this was a tornado. Winds at this location were estimated at 120 mph based on damage. The tornado moved quickly southeast, causing substantial tree damage with snapped trunks being common along the continued 50 to 100 yard wide track. The tornado moved through neighborhood of acreages along Quentin trail where it snapped many trees but moved in between the homes. The track then became more intermittent for a couple miles before it partially removed the roof of a home along 296th Street and caused additional narrow tree damage for the next two miles. The final damage point that was pretty clearly tornado damage was near 305th and Upton where 3 grain bins were crumpled and blown downstream and a machine shed sustained substantial damage. Beyond this point, the tree damage was sporadic and more evident of the larger scale wind field. Should also note that to the west of this tornado track, there was a debris signature evident on radar, but the damage was much more consistent with a focused downburst or series of downbursts that moved up from the Missouri Valley into the Loess Hills and may have helped to loft light leafy debris. This downburst likely led to the development of the eventual tornado.","A widespread significant damaging wind storm tracked across nearly all of eastern Nebraska and western Iowa on the morning of July 12.
